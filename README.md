# The Anubis

Although I named it as Anubis, this program is used to encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA algorithm.

## Usage

1. Go to the lib directory and run in your command line
   `cd ./Anubis/lib`

2. `python3 Anubis.py`

## Commands

1. `myKey` command shows public keys generated by program

2. `NewKey` command generates new public and private keys in userInfo.txt and prints pubic key

3. `encrypt` command : encrypt <public_key> <message>
        Note:
            The encrypted message ends with the following sequence:
            Ö<---THE MESSAGE ENDS HERE

4. `decrypt` <cipher_text> 
        Note:
            “Ö” do not pass this character
